# Black-Jack
This is a Black Jack game I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap Framework. The code looks messy but I'm planning to fix it as soon as I can. Also some basic features of the game are missing such as split and other things but these are going to be added pretty soon. Even though I used a lot of classes that Bootstrap provides, the page is not as responsive as a user would like it to be, so until I fix it I suggest you played in fullscreen.
