# Black-Jack
This is a Black Jack game I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap Framework. Split, which is a basic feature of the game is unfortunately missing but I'm planning to add it. Even though I used a lot of classes that Bootstrap provides, the page is not as responsive as a user would like it to be, so until I fix it I suggest you played in fullscreen.
